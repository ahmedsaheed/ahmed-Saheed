                                computer related information. Currently, i am engaging in college
                                work while doing some side projects and contributing to open source
                                . Also i am having a great time being lost in Tolstoy's Literature
                                alongside puzzling human existence. Please feel free and navigate
                                around, you're highly welcomed.
