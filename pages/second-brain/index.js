                                always expected that future human beings would have enormous heads
                                because they would have very big brains and they would be very wise.
                                It didn't work that ways, what happened is the human race is
                                building a brain outside its body. That is to say an interlocking
                                electronic network of telephonic, television, radionic communication
                                which is rapidly intelocked with computers, so that you will within
                                a few years be able to plug your brain into a computer".
