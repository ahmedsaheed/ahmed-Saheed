## 🧠 Ahmed's Second Brain: Kinda A Personal Digital Garden 🪴
---
 
This gardens focus not on being a definite source of truth, but rather a source which is constantly evolving as my own knowledge grows and changes

1. This garden was inspired by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) and [Anthony Morris](https://anthonymorris.dev/)

2. The notion of digital gardening is to subtly create reexplorable links within your ideas.


## Why keep a second brain isn't one enough?

> 📚 [I would like you to see this as further reading](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/)

Obviously, one brain is not enough! My ideas are like winds, I feel them, sometimes grasp them, and sometime it just blows away.
Man way reasoning and thinking are very difficult to understand, mine happens very disorderly and in a non linear manner which totally
contradict the ways in which ideas and thought are organise in modern times (linearly). 
The digital garden or second brain, approach is quite different from the traditional method of organising ideas and thought. It is a method where ideas are interwovenly connected together by links rather than the use of structure of files and folders.
## Do you want to keep a second brain?
