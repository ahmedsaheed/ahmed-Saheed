Leo Tolstoy is an emblematic figure in the history of a nation celebrated for its cultural achievements, one of the two or three contenders for the title of Russia's greatest writters.
Since the beginning of the year 2022, I have found a profund and uplifting experience whilst reading the great work of art and literature written by Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy popularly known as Leo Tostoy. I have been immersely impacted by his style of writing, the patterns of his thoughts, simplicity and subtleness in words.

To me, Leo is more than an ordinary writer, he is more of a religious thinker, a moral crusader and an inspirational predecessor of pacific protesters like [[Mahatma Ghandi]] .

> Some of my favorite quotes from Leo

-   "Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be."

-   "If you look for perfection, you'll never be content."

-   "We lost because we told ourselves we lost."

-   "Boredom: the desire for desires."

## Search For Religious Truth And Moral Purity

On completion of Leo's two masterpiece **Ana Karenina** and **War and Peace**, he spent eventless decades in his home where he became obsessed with a search for religious truth and moral purity, setting unattainable goals of righteousness for himself and his audience.

Leo dominated his thinking until the moment of his death by writings of a Genevan philosopher and political thinker [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau) who belived that human babies are born into natural state of goodness, only to be corrupted by education, inequality and immorality, a process which explains our lapses into bad behaviour.

The wonder is that the best of Leo's published works travels in opposite direction compared to the ideas Rousseau. _War and Peace_ is nothing but an affirmation of life.

Sadly, Leo died in 1910 at the age of 82, though the residue of his remarkable literature has long lived till this day which has now gained an unforgettable honor around the world
