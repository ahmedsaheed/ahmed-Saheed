### Hi Saheed,

This letter goes from my current self to my future self. I am currently writing from a dining table after having a hot bowl of noodles while listening to a chakra meditation sound. You might someday be reading this at a different place, in a different time doing absoluetly something else. 

I haven't written such a letter like this throughout my existence, but i'd try to make it organic as possible.

To begin,  i'd need to rewind a bit to your last days of secondary school. I think this letter would be absolutely incomplete without that flashback. 

### Early 2019

At that point your life felt abysmal and lacked meaning, You had just gotten into SS3 the final point of the Nigerian Secondary Education system. This was one of the most memorable moments of your life. You were quite young then  perphaps 15 or 16yo, getting ready for college and  embedding into your brain your then assumed imagination of a college student. At that age you hadn't understood anything about your thought process, You only did whatever you felt would please your peers irrespective of your parents words which were considered a burden. You lived in a very delusional and detestable bubble called life. Things really went fast! You eventually encircled yourself with a very wrong set of individuals which you looked up to and called your friends.

Time went by, and things got worst. You'd started using drugs, forgotten the nostalgic childhood dream of becoming an astronaut. Your imagination of being in a space suit, wandering the moon and being the like of  Dr. Ben Carson had suddenly been swallowed by this darkness within your inner self. What had really happended? Can you recall? 

This irrational way of life lasted a while and your parent started questioning. They became quite worried, the darkeness was visible around your dads conjunctiva. What and where have i done wrong were questions he asked himself. He felt terribly sad and you knew it. But you were to busy apeasing your so called friends!

### Late 2019

You'd finally graduated and a magnanimous graduation party was thrown for you, It wasn't necessary, but it was done none the less at the expense of your parent. Your grades wasn't excellent neither was it up to expectations but your parents still accepted it. 

Graduation had come to an end, all of your collegues and friends had moved on and splitted all around the country. You remained home waiting to be admitted into a university. Your parent ran helter-skelter to make sure you'd gotten accepted in your desired university, all to no avail. 

But your ill habits remained and needed to be sustained. You took forcefully from your parent purse. You felt this wasn't anything wrong besides it's for your parent! This continued till they couldn't take it any longer and became enraged by your attitude, your appearance and your way of life as a whole. You lacked  sense of remourse and empathy due to your emotional numbness caused by this sickness.

Now you hadn't heard from any university yet and you felt stuck in a chasm between your current illusion and reality. You became self aware but couldn't help it. But your parents where still willing to help. They lamented though but never left your side, they always wanted the best. You ended up in a mental facility.

You had settled in quite nicely in this new place, feeling serene and a stong sense of calm being far away from the hustle and bustle of the outer world. The inhabitants had shown you love, kindness and affection irrespective of some random arguements from time to time. Some were quite educated, others lay men but the majority was soldiers.

You'd been clean for a while now, spending time reading books like [the road less travelled](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347852.The_Road_Less_Traveled) and [Abnormal Psychology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/773020.Abnormal_Psychology), playing card game, table tennis and experimenting with psycho therapy.

You'd made friends with some really smart fellows like Dr Abdul-Salam, Dr Chineye , Uche the American college [dean enlisted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean%27s_list) dropout who i was greatly influenced by and the Civil Engineering graduate from University of Lagos.

### Early & Mid 2020

You had been allowed to leave this facility because you had to resume college at University of Lagos. Prior to resumption you'd been warned about relapse by both your therapist and your parents, your dad in particular. You'd also promised not to let them down.

Weeks went by as a freshman in college, you were doing great, not until you met some of your old peers from secondary school and decided to let yourself and loved once abashed and conscience-stricken.

This relapse was beyond your belief and far-fetched. It left you emotionally distorted. Those old darkness started creeping their way back into your life and this time eating deep into your endocardium. Your actions were outside your cognitive comprehension. It sucked and you knew it ! You felt like a swineherd returning to a pigsty immediately after taking hot shower.

### Late 2020
You'd become intolerable by your parent and your actions became notable and detesteble by the society around.

You decided to leave, perhaps it felt unbearable after what happend the afternoon you departed home. You weren't ready to feel any sort of remorse, instead you sought fault in your loved once and your upbringing. Delaying gratification and shying away from your reality. You were realistically disgusting and highly loathed!

You left, perphaps dad got back from work asking where you were or he was called that same moment of you departure, who knows. I wonder how he spent that night. Perphas so pained, he layed awake all night wiping the tears that rolled down his cheeks. 

You'd decided to trade your comfort, satiety, education and most importantly your loved ones for an absolutely nonworthy cause. You accepted your own self made lies!

None the less he still came looking for you. He loved you down to earth! He saw something positively distinct and clearcut about you. 

With a leap of fate, he believed in you and sent you 3,198 miles away from home for enquire quality education and pursue a better life. He begged not to be disappointed.

### 2021 Starting Anew

![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b9/09/6c/b9096cf99af608099092505cefd2dd96.jpg)

I ended up in Europe, unbelievable! i took awhile to to clearly grasp the message ([[cities-ambition]]) of this new society. I felt a bit overwhelmed at first about the protrayed solemnity of my new settlement, it felt absolutely contrary to what i was used to.

Time passed, I'd started a new school, settled in nicely and remained alone, not out of choice but out of fear for having wrong friends again and going down the old route i'd just miraculously escaped.

Lectures at school initially felt like a conundrum. I had decided to take Computer Science which deep down i'm very capable of handling. I felt very defeated by the workload but never let go. I struggled and couragously passed my first exam in europe.

### 2022
Away from the madding crowd, living a silent life in the age of noise, you'd fellen in love with [books](/books) and [programming](https://github.com/ahmedsaheed) also mountaineering but haven't had a chance to climb on yet. 

I've grown alot also learnt a reasonable amount of stuff.  I turned 19yo few months ago! I really wonder how time passes bye so fast. This transformation in my life over a couple of years has left me perplexed. I have acquired a more broaden and enlightened view of myself and the larger society. 

Enough time has been spent pondering on my true self. i.e who i am now and who i want to really be. I have found the subtleness in self love and societal good. I have also outlined some noticable flaws to be worked on. Most of these are easier said than done, but deep down it's for nobody except oneself. 

> I currently see myself as a sailor and my body as a ship. This ship sails on an ocean consisting of all sort of things. My job as a sailor is to protect this ship from sinking at all cost. Making it sacred and safe from danger.

I would keep writing to you more often in absolute honesty. 
I hope you're doing exceptionally well whenever you read this.

Yours truthfully, 
Ahmed.
