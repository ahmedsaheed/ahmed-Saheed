> I am persuaded that normal human beings are biologically built for an activity that is aimed towards a goal and that idleness, or aimless work gives rise to suffering and to entropy
 - Primo Levi
 
 
 > We took risks, we knew we took them; things have come against us, and therefore we have no cause to complain, but bow to the will of providence, determined still to do our best to the last
  - Robert Falcon Scott

> The one great advantage which inexperience confers on an amateur is that he is not bogged down by the tradition or precedence. To him, all things appears simple and he chooses straightforward solutions to the problem he faces. Often, of cause, it defeats the sucess his seeking, and sometimes it has tragic results, but the man himself doesn't know this when he sets out on his adventure
- Walt Unsworth 

> But there are some men for whom the unattanable has a special attraction. Usually they are not experts: their ambition and fantasies are strong enough to brush aside the doubt which more cautious men might have. Determination and faith are their strongest weapons. At best such men are regarded as eccentric; at worst, mad ...

> The more impropable the situation and the greater the demand on a man, the more sweetly his blood flows later in release from all the tension. The possiblity of danger serves merely to sharpen his awareness and control. And perphas this is rationale to all risky activities: You delibrately raise the ante of effort and concentration in order, as its were, to clear your mind of all trivialities.

 >It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one’s limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength—whether it’s in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way. Nature gave us pain as a messaging device to tell us that we are approaching, or that we have exceeded, our limits in some way. At the same time, nature made the process of getting stronger require us to push our limits. Gaining strength is the adaptation process of the body and the mind to encountering one’s limits, which is painful. In other words, both pain and strength typically result from encountering one’s barriers. When we encounter pain, we are at an important juncture in our decision-making process
- Ray Dalio

>What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!'

>Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.' If this thought gained possession of you, it would change you as you are or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, 'Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?' would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight. Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life?

- Nietzsche
