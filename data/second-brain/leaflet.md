Leaflet, a **minimal distractionless markdown editor** designed to quickly navigate between multiple `.md` files in a directory and its sub directories. It features a clean mathematical typesetting, chemical equation rendering, code blocks highlighting, writing statistics and a speed-reader.


I created this <a href="http://github.com/ahmedsaheed/Leaflet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="external ">application</a> to help me cope with note taking during school lectures as most of my lecturers spoke too fast. This application is made available as a free and <a href="https://github.com/ahmedsaheed/Leaflet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="external ">open source</a> software.
