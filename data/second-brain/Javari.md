God is real and he using me for a bigger purpose  
So fuck the world that would have you think that a nigga is  worthless

Sometimes I think that these verses can help a person  
way more than the ones they reading in churches on days of worship .

No disrespect to the Lord and Savior, that ain't just ego. I just observe that them words no longer relate to people because  modern times are flooded with dollar signs.
And social media stunting, most niggas just wanna shine.

They frame of mind so far removed from the days and times of Nazareth. Life these days is a labyrinth, in a maze so elaborate we barely get through half of it before it's too late.

All of that to say maybe the hood need a new faith  
A new story about a boy from not too far where you stay

---


His momma was a virgin named Yolanda  
And she raised him on her own, after she was disowned. 
Her momma called her a liar, said "Get the fuck out my home"  
Since you wanna be grown  
So, there she was now, seventeen and alone.

But this lil' boy that grew in her stomach made her feel strong  
The angels paid her a visit one night and let it be known  
This was God's child, woman behold the miracle.  
She shed tears 'cause she never believed in a spiritual  
But her heart was pure and she was good  
For eighteen years she raised him on Section 8 in the cold embrace of the hood. 
Did the best as she could, the boy was named Javari  
Walked with the spirit of his father emanating from body.

Back in the hood, look at lil' Vari preach  
His words were full of spirit, his truth it would always reach  
He laid his hands on Toya, when niggas called her a freak  
And told her that God loved her no matter who she let beat

But being promiscuous is a sign that there's something deep  
That troubles her soul, the day she lets it go, she'll find peace  
She broke down admitting her stepfather had touched her for years  
She kept it secret for fear of her mother's grief  
Now the bitterness she feels for that nigga is at a peak  
And her lack of self-esteem is the reason that she would sleep with anybody

And not think twice, Javari spoke calmly  
Instructing her to forgive her stepfather  
Though he was wrong he was sick  
Afflicted by evil, but the power to switch  
How you feel about people who hurt you is truly a gift  
The thing that can make you rich or keep you down in a ditch  
If you refuse to let go of the ground, then how can you lift?  
Into the sky where you belong with the most high  
Now wipe those tears from your eyes, my father wants you to fly.

Back in the hood, Javari built up a following  
Niggas put down they pistols eventually  
And stopped swallowing molly pills Instead their bodies filled with spirit  
Twelve lil' homies soaking up every word that they hearing

The neighborhood changed in attitude and appearance  
Police dumbfounded by lack of crime and they swear it's a fluke  
Not knowing the truth, that this a miracle  
Niggas is waking up with the powers that be they fearing

---

So government keep a tap on Javari and those who practice adherence  
To things he teaching and then comes to interference

They stormed the hood, guns out  
Bust into the house that he slept in  
A warrant claiming suspicion of drug possession  
But Vari sat calmly as if he had been expecting  
Heart full of love, even for those who need to oppress him

They told him "Hands up" and he did just as they directed  
They fired on him, claiming they thought he reached for a weapon  
He laid on the floor breathless, blood leaking from his chest

Plus a bullet-hole through both of his palms, ain't that a message?

The neighborhood was stressing 
The son of God murdered and carried away on stretcher by the oppressor.

Three days later, the coroner pulled the table  
And what happened next is like somethin' you see on cable or hear in a fable

He was suddenly able to open his eyes, look at him rise, the coroner was surprised  
Without a word Javari walked out, went straight to the hood  
The people couldn't believe it, they froze right where they stood

As he walked by, God flowin' from every inch of his frame  
He said "Hear me out my niggas, let me be your proof, my father is real  
And through love, homie, peace can be found I died for you, so that one day you would be able to see you a child of God, just like me"
