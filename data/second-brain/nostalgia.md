_A small sweet magical poetry from a friend_

Hello, its me, I've been wondering if after all these long months you'd like to chat, to go over everything? It's said that time heal but it ain't got so much healing. 

>No distance of place or lapse of time can lessen the friendship of those who are thoroughly persuaded of each otherâ€™s worth.

**those yearnings**

It was me or was it? <br>
Giving you a lot if space, I got lost in mine. 

Left like hail in summer<br>
I couldn't keep up with the times.

Yet i hear your voice again and again in my head.

Shadows of you linger in my playlist. <br>
Books you had read were my solace.

A lot busy yet still thought of you<br>
I wallow in misery thinking about the old.<br>
There sure were good times but better did happen.

As i write this beyond  distances i ponder why I'm doing this?<br>
I couldn't let go......... 


>Sweet are the memory of distant friends! Like the mellow rays of the departing sun, it falls tenderly, yet sadly, on the heart.
