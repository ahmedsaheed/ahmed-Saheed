*A sweet  poetry from a friend*

Hello, its me, I've been wondering if after all these long months you'd like to chat, to go over everything? It's said that time heal but it ain't got so much healing. 

>No distance of place or lapse of time can lessen the friendship of those who are thoroughly persuaded of each otherâ€™s worth.

**those yearnings**

Was it me or was it? <br>
Giving you a lot of space<br>I got lost in mine. 

Left like hail in summer<br>
I couldn't keep up with the times.

Yet i hear your voice repeatedly in my head.

Shadows of you linger in my playlist. <br>
[Books](/books) you had read were my solace.

Densely busy, yet still thought of you<br>
I wallow in misery reminisce about the past.<br>
Those were surely good times but better did happen.

As i write this beyond  distances i ponder why I'm doing this?<br>
I couldn't let go......... 


>Sweet are the memory of distant friends! Like the mellow rays of the departing sun, it falls tenderly, yet sadly, on the heart.
