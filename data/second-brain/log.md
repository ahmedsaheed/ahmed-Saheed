My words are limited, perphaps enormous on the inside but as I try to force these words through my fingers and onto my leaflet, they seemed to flutter away and vanish, refusing to be expressed in any precise form.

Lately, i've been living in a state emotional numbness which opposes my real self who's filled with empathy and bursting in emotions. perhaps, this is because nothing really special has been taking place on my daily life or as a result of lack of friends with like mindset or even lack of inner drive.

Although, somethimes i tend to to convience myself that this might actually be the right lifestyle for myself. Away from the madding crowd, away in an **inferior** state of repose and away in silence during an age of noise.

> Certainly, the word `exile` itself now enters the ears more harshly through a sort of conviction and popular belief, and strikes the listener to be detestible. For that is people's verdicts, but wise men on the whole reject the people's decree

I am aware that in my spirit lives a sort of inborn restlessness. For my mind is certainly very unsettled, darting about and directing thoughts to all places known and unknown. Perhaps I am a wanderer who's struggling to endure solemnity.

I've been working on `leaflet`, which i'm current using to document this log. This is the first tool i've created for the sole purpose of my need i.e documenting my feelings and jornaling. This project has brought some tranquil into my wandering mind. It's strongly inspired by (100r.co's Leaf)[https://100r.co/site/left.html] 


Today, 9/9/22 i got my final intern interview at microsoft scheduled. I have no idea how i feel. I'm very positive though.

I'm currently reading On The Shortness Of Life By Seneca.
