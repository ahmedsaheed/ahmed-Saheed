# Future of this blog

Greetings, fellow readers. It is Ahmed here, and after a year-long hiatus, I have made the decision to resume blogging. Although I do not consider myself a professional writer, I do believe that writing can serve as a subtle form of self-expression.

## So why write again ?

Rather than regarding it as ordinary writing, I view it as a means of gathering my thoughts and accessing my own interiority. In his renowned 1959 work, The Sociological Imagination, Wright Mills advised his students to capture their experiences and sort them out in order to use them to guide and test their reflections and shape themselves as intellectual craftsmen.

On this very blog, I aspire to collect my intellectual pursuits and personal experiences. I will not shy away from using these experiences to connect with works in progress, nor will I hesitate to explore "fringe-thoughts" and various ideas that may result from everyday life. This blog will serve as a platform to contemplate and process experiences, a space for distillation, and a storage unit for my fading memory.

While I enjoy sharing my thoughts and engaging with your ideas, I must emphasize that this blog is primarily for me. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy it as well. As the late Aaron Swartz once said, "It's not for you, it's for me. But I hope you enjoy it anyway."

<sup>Thank you for reading!</sup>
