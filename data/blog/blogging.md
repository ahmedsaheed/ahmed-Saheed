# Future of this blog

Hello everyone! ahmed here. Today, i've decided to recommence blogging. About a year ago, i had an active blog although due to my inability to express the labyrinth of my mind through written words i had to shut it down. That being said, i don't actually see myself as  a bad writer, neither i'm a professional, but i've come to realise that  i don't  really asking myself the approprate question whenever i settle to write. 

## So why write again ?

Personally,  i won't be considering this a form of mere writing, but more like a process of gathering my thoughts - a way for me access my own interiority and create a something out it. Reductively, taking consistent walks through the network of my ideas and emotions.

In his 1959 classic, _The Sociological Imagination_, Wright Mills told students of his discipline:

>  You'd have to … capture what you experience and sort it out; only in this way can you hope to use it to guide and test your reflection, and in the process shape yourself as an intellectual craftsman.

Here, on this blog, i'll  try to gather what i'm doing intellectually and my experiences as a person.  On this blog, i won't be afraid to use these experiences and relate them directly to various work in progress. By serving as a check on repetitious work, this blog would also encourage constistent capturing of ‘fringe-thoughts’ and various ideas which may be byproducts of everyday life. It would be a place to contemplate and process experience, a space for distillation and a storage for my atrophying memory. 

As Aaron Swartz says "I like sharing my thoughts and I like hearing yours and I like practicing expressing ideas, but fundamentally this blog is not for you, it’s for me. I hope that you enjoy it anyway."
