# Future of this blog

Hello everyone! ahmed here. Today, i've decided to recommence blogging. About a year ago, i had an active blog although i had to shut it down. I don't actually think of myself as a bad writer, neither i'm a professional. But i've come to realise that writing can be a subtle form of self expression.

## So why write again ?

Ideally, i won't be considering this a form of ordinary writing, but more like a process of thoughts gathering - a way to access my own interiority and create a something out it. 

In his 1959 classic, *The Sociological Imagination*, Wright Mills told students of his discipline:

> You'd have to … capture what you experience and sort it out; only in this way can you hope to use it to guide and test your reflection, and in the process shape yourself as an intellectual craftsman.

Here, on this blog, i'll try to gather what i'm doing intellectually and my experiences as a person. On this blog, i won't be afraid to use these experiences and relate them directly to various work in progress. By serving as a check on repetitious work. This blog would also encourage capturing of ‘fringe-thoughts’ and various ideas which may be byproducts of everyday life. It would be a place to contemplate and process experience, a space for distillation and a storage for my atrophying memory.

I like sharing my thoughts and listening to yours and also practicing expressing ideas, but fundamentally this blog is not for you, it’s for me. I hope that you enjoy it anyway -- aaronsw.

Thanks for reading!
